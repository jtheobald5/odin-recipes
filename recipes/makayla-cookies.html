    <h4>Cookies with bits of chocolate in them</h4>

    <p>This recipe is my girlfriend's (Makayla) favorite recipe for chocolate chip cookies</p>

    <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup salted butter softened</li>
            <li>1 cup white (granulated) sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup light brown sugar (packed)</li>
            <li>2 tsp vanilla</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>3 cups flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 tsp baking powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp sea salt</li>
            <li>2 cups chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
    <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking pan with parchment paper and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                In a separate bowl mix flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cream together butter and sugars until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Beat in eggs and vanilla until fluffy.
            </li>
            <li>
                Mix in the dry ingredients until combined.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 12 oz package of chocolate chips and mix well.
            </li>
            <li>
                Roll 2-3 TBS (depending on how large you like your cookies) of dough at a time into balls and place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie sheets. (alternately, use a small cookie scoop to make your cookies).
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in preheated oven for approximately 8-10 minutes. Take them out when they are just BARELY starting to turn brown.
            </li>
            <li>
                Let them sit on the baking pan for 2 minutes before removing to cooling rack.
            </li>
        </ol>
    <h5>Notes:</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>Recipe information calculated based on this recipe making 36 cookies - 2 TBS of dough a piece)</li>
<li><p>Do not over bake</p>
When you remove the cookies from the oven they will still look doughy. THIS is the secret that makes these cookies so absolutely amazing! Please, I beg you, do NOT over bake!</li>
<li><p>Ingredient Substitutions:</p>
<p>Butter. I use salted butter, but unsalted butter would also be great. I just recommend tasting the dough to ensure that it's salted to your liking.</p>
<p>White Sugar.  You can use granulated white sugar or organic cane sugar.</p>
<p>Brown sugar. I use light brown sugar in this recipe for the best results.</p>
<p>Flour. I recommend using an unbleached, all-purpose flour to make these chocolate chip cookies. Many readers have used gluten-free all-purpose flour with excellent results. </p>
<p>Sea Salt. I exclusively bake and cook with pure, fine sea salt. Sea salt is different than table salt (that is iodized), so if you use salt other than sea salt I recommend testing the recipe first with Â½ tsp and then adjusting to your taste.</p>
<p>Chocolate Chips. As you can see from the photos, sometimes I use chocolate chunks, chopped chocolate, or chocolate chips. It doesn't matter what you use, as long as you use 2 cups.</p></li>
<li>How to freeze chocolate chip cookie dough
Portion dough, roll into balls and freeze in a single layer in an airtight container for up to 2 months.</li> 
<li><p>Note on the amount of flour in grams - the traditional conversion from cups to grams is 120 g all-purpose flour in 1 cup, which would mean this recipe needs 360 g flour. When I weigh the flour I use to make the perfect cookies it comes out to be 430 to 450 g depending on the size of my eggs. I suggest starting with 360 and increasing as necessary. The dough should not be wet or sticky but it also should not be dry or crumbly.</p></li>
<li>Storage
<p>Store these chocolate chip cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days, or in the freezer for up to 2 months.</p></li>
    </ul>
